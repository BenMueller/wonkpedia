== Articles ==

* There should probably be some pages on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
* There should '''definitely''' be a technical page on Hypersonic glide vehicles. Probably multiple pages, TBH.
* Someone should go through the FAS Nuclear notebook<ref>https://twitter.com/mattkorda/status/1460650157528260619</ref> and the DOD's "Military and Security Developments Involving the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China"<ref>https://media.defense.gov/2021/Nov/03/2002885874/-1/-1/0/2021-CMPR-FINAL.PDF</ref>, summarizing the details into some pages. Maybe appropriate for history/current systems pages?
* Maybe do an article on the decision (or lack of decision) to drop the bomb on Japan. Jeffrey's policy class has a bunch of the relevant documents as a reference to start from, as well as the Shaun video (plus I think there's a twitter thread floating around listing the dozens of conclusions over the years and the original books that argued them)
* There probably should be some articles on the ICBM fields being built in China, and how they tie back to the MX basing study (probably do an article on that alone lol)
* this thread on drones looks interesting<ref>https://twitter.com/arawnsley/status/1454093333115113473?s=20</ref>
* Maybe do an article on Taiwan and how the self-identity/status of the Taiwanese people has changed over time.<ref>https://english.president.gov.tw/NEWS/6169</ref>

== Guides ==

* How to identify different types of rockets/fuels by the plume/flame. Solid vs. liquid is pretty easy, but what is the variation between different liquid fuel colors?
* There's a bunch of stuff from Jeffrey's open source class that I could make guides on (get permission first)
* Do one on image search. This is also very cool.<ref>https://twitter.com/henkvaness/status/1463588201961074693</ref> There's also some esoteric techniques that nobody really talks about/change over time.
* Guide to North Korean primary sources. Rodong Simund, Uriminzokkiri, twitter, youtube, south korean broadcasting channels, etc.
* searching Chinese video platforms like bilibili, youku, etc. for open source stuff
