Sometime around the Summer of 2021, China appears to have tested a yet-unnamed FOBS system, or perhaps an orbital vehicle similar to the [[X-37 Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV)|X-37B]]. Reactions by news commentators and (some) generals was quick: the event was referenced as a "Sputnik Moment" where the Chinese had apparently done the impossible.<ref>https://twitter.com/blakehounshell/status/1449465257785712643</ref> However, many experts disagreed and recommended that policymakers exercise caution around overreacting.<ref>https://breakingdefense.com/2021/09/global-strike-from-space-did-kendall-reveal-chinese-threat/</ref><ref>https://nucleardiner.wordpress.com/2021/10/19/chinas-new-missile-system/</ref>

==What we actually know==
In short: very little, at least right now. China has confirmed '''a''' test, but not of any weapons system (instead claiming it was a routine test of a "space vehicle").<ref>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-disputes-report-hypersonic-missile-test-says-tested-space-vehicle-2021-10-18/</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/Joshua_Pollack/status/1450156584965967874/photo/1</ref> To be clear, this isn't an impossible claim, but the evidence is mixed. It does appear that on July 16, [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation|CASC]] announced a suborbital spaceplane flight. However, the details are inconsistent with the claimed FOBS system.<ref>https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/42779/chinas-claim-that-its-fractional-orbital-bombardment-system-was-a-spaceplane-test-doesnt-add-up</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/brianweeden/status/1450079406643367938?s=20</ref>

==Why FOBS?==
{{main|FOBS (Fractional Orbital Bombardment System)}}One of the reasons that China may be pursuing FOBS is to circumvent concerns around the development of American missile defense systems. This action would echo Soviet concerns over the Safeguard defense system.<ref>https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/18/hypersonic-china-missile-nuclear-fobs/</ref> Another aspect may be Chinese concerns over the X-37B itself, as the system could be redeveloped to be nuclear-capable. That is to say, is every spaceplane now a FOBS?<ref>https://twitter.com/brianweeden/status/1450079411118788612?s=20</ref>
