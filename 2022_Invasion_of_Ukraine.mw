The 2022 Invasion of Ukraine is currently likely taking place on Wednesday, February 23. The day before SAR imagery was observed with vehicles lining up, as if for an invasion. Later in the day, people observed traffic jams on Google Maps and Yandex around Ukraine as the columns began moving, and numerous attempts to broker last-minute peace between Ukraine and Russia all fell through. This page will be updated as events continue to occur.


By 7:00 PM PST, the traffic jam had moved past the Russian border. Oddly enough Marco Rubio was one of the first people to speak publicly of the invasion. The UN security council within a number of minutes got together and started speaking, pleading for peace, not like they had much of a chance. At the same time they were speaking, rockets started falling on Ukraine.
