[[Todo]]: this page should talk about the history of missiles and missile development. Start with e.g. Von Braun and the V2, then go from there to the parallel developments of the US and Soviet spheres. Talk about how those continued to develop, the generations of missile technology, applications like the space race, solid vs. liquid, how missile technology gets exported to countries like Egypt and DPRK, the different types of missiles and how they're considered strategically.
