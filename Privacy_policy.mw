== Copyright Violations ==
If you are a copyright owner or represent a copyright owner, and you believe that Wonkpedia is infringing your copyright, the quickest solution is to post a notice on the talk page of the content in dispute. If it is a clear violation then it should be removed promptly.

If you would rather not make such a post, or are unhappy with the outcome, a request for review should be sent to: [mailto:bmueller@madwonk.com bmueller@madwonk.com]. Include the relevant URL for the content in dispute, and any information that may help in ascertaining that you are indeed the owner or represent the owner of the copyrighted work.

Before making any infringement claims please be aware that Wonkpedia regularly exercises a [[fair use]] right to copy portions of copyrighted works for the purposes of criticism, commentary, and research. While we take copyright concerns very seriously here, and will do our best to reach an amicable agreement for all parties, we will not be intimidated by false claims of copyright infringement made for the purpose of removing valid criticism from the site.
