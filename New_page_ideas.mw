== Articles ==

* There should probably be some pages on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

== Guides ==

* How to identify different types of rockets/fuels by the plume/flame. Solid vs. liquid is pretty easy, but what is the variation between different liquid fuel colors?
* There's a bunch of stuff from Jeffrey's open source class that I could make guides on (get permission first)
