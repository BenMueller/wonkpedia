== Articles ==

* There should probably be some pages on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
* There should '''definitely''' be a technical page on Hypersonic glide vehicles. Probably multiple pages, TBH.
* Someone should go through the FAS Nuclear notebook<ref>https://twitter.com/mattkorda/status/1460650157528260619</ref> and the DOD's "Military and Security Developments Involving the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China"<ref>https://media.defense.gov/2021/Nov/03/2002885874/-1/-1/0/2021-CMPR-FINAL.PDF</ref>, summarizing the details into some pages. Maybe appropriate for history/current systems pages?
* Maybe do an article on the decision (or lack of decision) to drop the bomb on Japan. Jeffrey's policy class has a bunch of the relevant documents as a reference to start from, as well as the Shaun video (plus I think there's a twitter thread floating around listing the dozens of conclusions over the years and the original books that argued them)
* There probably should be some articles on the ICBM fields being built in China, and how they tie back to the MX basing study (probably do an article on that alone lol)
* this thread on drones looks interesting<ref>https://twitter.com/arawnsley/status/1454093333115113473?s=20</ref>
* Maybe do an article on Taiwan and how the self-identity/status of the Taiwanese people has changed over time.<ref>https://english.president.gov.tw/NEWS/6169</ref>
* Article on [[Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST)|Pyongyang University of Science and Technology]]<ref>https://www.38north.org/2010/11/pyongyang-university-and-nk-just-do-it/</ref>
* Military-industrial contractor [[China Great Wall Industry Corporation]], and maybe do some work relating it to [[Taiyuan]]?<ref>https://rocketrundown.com/home/launch-sites/taiyuan-satellite-launch-center/</ref><ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/china/taiyuan.htm</ref>
* more stuff on the Chinese missile fields<ref>https://fas.org/blogs/security/2021/11/a-closer-look-at-chinas-missile-silo-construction/</ref>
* what is the Juchebird
* This is a really cool example of using Sentinel imagery to detect engine tests. Put it somewhere?<ref>https://twitter.com/GeorgeWHerbert/status/1464829717379309568</ref>
* We '''NEED''' a page on Jilantai<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/china/jilantai.htm</ref>
* Once Battle At Lake Changjin gets a disc/prime release, someone should go through it and write an article on all the innacuracies/propaganda aspects of it. Maybe put it under "fun"?
* Do a page on DPRK Worker Party Congress, how they don't happen often, and what has historically been announced (vs actually tested)
* Page on the Chinese JL-2 Launcher<ref>https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/jl-2/</ref>
* Page on this radar site<ref>https://www.griffissinstitute.org/who-we-work-with/afrl/newport-research-site</ref>
* Page on Pyongyang General Satellite Control Center (old one at Sanumdong?)
* Pages on the North Korean television network/system: towers, broadcast, technology, etc. (using new research if possible)
* Page on Korean Computer Center<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Computer_Center</ref>

== Guides ==

* How to identify different types of rockets/fuels by the plume/flame. Solid vs. liquid is pretty easy, but what is the variation between different liquid fuel colors?
* There's a bunch of stuff from Jeffrey's open source class that I could make guides on (get permission first)
* Do one on image search. This is also very cool.<ref>https://twitter.com/henkvaness/status/1463588201961074693</ref> There's also some esoteric techniques that nobody really talks about/change over time.
* Guide to North Korean primary sources. Rodong Simund, Uriminzokkiri, twitter, youtube, south korean broadcasting channels, etc.<ref>https://archive.org/details/NorthKoreanPropagandaFilms</ref>
* searching Chinese video platforms like bilibili, youku, etc. for open source stuff
* downloading videos with youtube-dl or similar (maybe we should have a request form for videos to be archived here?)
* did that guide on naming conventions/databases ever get finished?<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd//world/dprk/tae-sung.htm</ref><ref>https://geonames.nga.mil/namesgaz/</ref>
* Do imagery analysis using forensicly (similar to tungsten, but we need a good case study)<ref>https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/</ref>
* o m g<ref>https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario/acquisition-segments</ref>
