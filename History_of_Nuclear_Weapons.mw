[[Todo]]: this page should talk about the history of nuclear weapons. Start with Manhattan project, then probably base a bunch of stuff on The Making of the Atomic/Hydrogen bomb, other original sources like Danger & Survival, etc. Also things like Wizards of Armageddon are good sources for the history of the later nuclear era.
