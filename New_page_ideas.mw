== Articles ==

* There should probably be some pages on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
* There should '''definitely''' be a technical page on Hypersonic glide vehicles. Probably multiple pages, TBH.
* Someone should go through the FAS Nuclear notebook<ref>https://twitter.com/mattkorda/status/1460650157528260619</ref> and the DOD's "Military and Security Developments Involving the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China"<ref>https://media.defense.gov/2021/Nov/03/2002885874/-1/-1/0/2021-CMPR-FINAL.PDF</ref>, summarizing the details into some pages. Maybe appropriate for history/current systems pages?

== Guides ==

* How to identify different types of rockets/fuels by the plume/flame. Solid vs. liquid is pretty easy, but what is the variation between different liquid fuel colors?
* There's a bunch of stuff from Jeffrey's open source class that I could make guides on (get permission first)
