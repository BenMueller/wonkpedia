{{Main|Timeline of DPRK Missile testing}}

North Korea has had several phases in missile development and testing. Most early missiles were based on SCUD designs of some variant, followed by more domestically designed missiles later on. There was a large push for testing from when Kim-Jong Un took power in 2011 to 2018, when dialogue between the South and Donald Trump began. However, it has been argued this simply gave them time to develop new systems to test, as they began testing multiple new, more advanced systems once talks fell apart.
TODO: add sources for this section, more detail, etc.
