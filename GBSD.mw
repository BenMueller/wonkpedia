'''GBSD''', or the '''Ground Based Strategic Deterrent''' is an American modernization of the existing ground-based leg of the nuclear triad. TODO: base some of this on the equivalent GBSD wikipedia article, but also add things heavily based on the existing nonpro literature/debate/discussion. Matt Korda's work is a good source on much of that.
