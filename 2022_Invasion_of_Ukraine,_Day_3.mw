Day three of the Ukrainian invasion showed some successes for Ukraine and serious blunders on behalf of the Russian forces.

Okay, so apparently a Russian convoy was defeated in Western Kyiv 50.459003째  30.410094째  and a SECOND IL-76 transport aircraft (potentially with over a 100 soldiers?) was confirmed as shot down by Ukraine.<ref>https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1497430637166407686</ref> However, fighting in the early hours is getting into the residential districts and outskirts of the city itself, slowly moving inward from the west.<ref>https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1497386752054546433</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1497411609882464256</ref> Again the question is asked, with Russian troops on the ground walking towards the capital, how long can they last? 48 hours? Cluster munitions allegedly being used.<ref>https://twitter.com/johnismay/status/1497351208864043010?s=20&t=6WcMnBkg3AiC1O8DPpwhxA</ref> At least some successes have been occurring in Kharkov, with Ukrainian soldiers showing off captured Russian patches.<ref>https://twitter.com/NotWoofers/status/1497420141197463555</ref>
