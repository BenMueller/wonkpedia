Day three of the Ukrainian invasion showed some successes for Ukraine and serious blunders on behalf of the Russian forces.

== Events ==
Okay, so apparently a Russian convoy was defeated in Western Kyiv 50.459003°  30.410094°  and a SECOND IL-76 transport aircraft (potentially with over a 100 soldiers?) was confirmed as shot down by Ukraine.
