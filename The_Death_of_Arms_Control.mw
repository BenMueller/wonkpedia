The Death of Arms Control is a topic of discussion following the failure to further continue disarmament after the massive reductions made immediately around the era of the collapse of the Soviet Union. In fact, many scholars today feel we're on the edge of a whole ''new'' arms race, where new countries like Iran and North Korea enter the nuclear sphere, and in which existing nuclear-armed countries like China, Russia, India, Pakistan, and Israel are all simultaneously looking to expand their arsenals beyond their current capabilities. This article seeks to document both how and why the last two decades of Arms Control have fundamentally failed to succeed at concrete reductions.
