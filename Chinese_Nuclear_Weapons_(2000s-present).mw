In the last few decades, China has begun to shift its nuclear posture and developments from a small, static force towards a larger force with more capabilities (and consequently opening the door to move away from a no-first use policy). This article discusses the recent history of China's nuclear competition and investments, and attempts to list some potential explanations as to ''why'' these changes are being made.

==What has China been developing/building?==

===Hypersonic Glide Vehicles===
{{main|Unnamed Chinese Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV)}}
Recently, China has been developing a number of previously unknown/unidentified HGVs. Over Summer 2021, China conducted multiple tests of these systems, much to the surprise of many who assumed they had no HGV ambitions.<ref>https://www.ft.com/content/c7139a23-1271-43ae-975b-9b632330130b</ref>

===Nuclear Silo Field(s)===
{{main|Chinese Silo Fields}}Thanks to the great work of some fellow wonks, major construction was found at two different sites in western China, indicating a massive construction project that amounts to a massive silo field. Similar in design to the MPS system in the [[MX Basing Study]], altogether we end up with a picture indicating significant nuclear expansion by China.<ref>https://fas.org/blogs/security/2021/07/china-is-building-a-second-nuclear-missile-silo-field/</ref>

=== Fissile Material production? ===
Some have argued that the rapid ramp-up of nuclear energy generation in China serves the dual purpose of allowing fissile material production and eventual reprocessing for future weapons; however, this is currently little more than speculation.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-nuclear-reprocessing-create-stockpiles-weapons-level-materials-experts-2021-03-25/</ref>
