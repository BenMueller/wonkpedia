== Getting an Account ==
If you don't have an account and want one, fill out the form [https://www.madwonk.com/wonkpedia-application here].

If you have an account and aren't sure where to start, Wikipedia has a good [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia contribution guide] worth glancing through. For the short version, read below!

== Community Guidelines ==
The goal of the Wonkpedia is to help improve the quality and documentation of open-source nonproliferation work taking place across the field. To achieve this goal, there are a few main rules that members need to follow:

*'''Be good to the community''' — in other words, no flame wars, direct insults, attacks, or really anything that would create a toxic environment.
*'''Follow the law''' — Don't post stuff that will get the wiki in trouble, or which will get people doxxed. This one should be pretty obvious.
*'''Have fun''' — Don't ever feel like you ''need'' to contribute, and make sure to put your mental health first. This field can be pretty heavy, so having [[Fun|fun]] sometimes is a hard requirement.

== Standards ==
The quality of pages doesn't necessarily need to be as high as Wikipedia. Which is to say, citing a tweet thread or slack post is acceptable given it's generally supportable by facts and/or involved with open-source research being documented. However, where possible it's preferable to back those up with better, more established sources. (In the case of a private slack, '''make sure''' you get permission before citing people.)

For example, let's say that someone geolocates an engine test facility and posts a tweet about it. While the tweet itself is a sufficient source, you might want to also cite any articles, research, or blog posts that corroborate the information, or were used in the research process. Additionally, including images of the site itself may help readers to verify the research.

In accordance with Rule #3, spicing up articles with humor, sarcasm, and satire is allowed and encouraged, within reason. Separate '''fun''' pages are also encouraged on topics like [[Fun:EMP|EMP]].
