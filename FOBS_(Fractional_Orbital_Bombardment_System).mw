'''FOBS''' are a form of weapon delivery system which enters Earth orbit before de-orbiting and falling back into the atmosphere towards a target. You can think about it like an ICBM that takes the longer route in space instead of the shorter, direct "ballistic" route (where the missile simply goes up and down).

== Technical Details ==
So, why would you send your favorite energetic package via FOBS instead of, say, a more conventional ICBM? Perhaps you're a country like [[North Korea]], whose ballistic trajectory would pass over American missile defenses in Alaska and Canada. Since FOBS goes into orbit, you aren't limited to the shortest path (over the North Pole), and you can instead go the "long" way (say, over the South Pole where there are currently no missile defenses).


FOBS requires a bigger missile to reach the high speeds necessary for orbit, and may require more advanced staging and control upon reentry (or in the case a reentry burn is required).
