== Bias on Wonkpedia ==
One of the best things about Wikipedia is the goal to strive for an unbiased, neutral tone. It's one of the reasons it has the wealth of accurate information it does. However, this creates some limitations in the scope of thinking in terms of the Arms Control field. For one, it reinforces the existing status quo against nonproliferation. For another, it doesn't allow you to categorize speculation or bleeding-edge research in the field.


Wonkpedia has no such illusions of being unbiased on Arms Control. In other words: '''Wonkpedia is explicitly in support of Arms Control'''. We are under no illusions that a nuclear war can be won, or that the current "status quo" of nuclear strategy is sustainable forever.
