'''Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center''' ('''JSLC'''; {{zh|c=酒泉卫星发射中心|p=Jiǔquán Wèixīng Fāshè Zhōngxīn}} also known as Shuangchengzi Missile Test Center; Launch Complex B2; formally Northwest Comprehensive Missile Testing Facility ({{lang|zh|西北综合导弹试验基地}}); Base 20; 63600 Unit)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nti.org/learn/facilities/71/|title=Jiuquan Space Launch Center - Facilities - NTI|website=www.nti.org|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> is a Chinese [[space vehicle]] launch facility ([[spaceport]]) located in the [[Gobi Desert]], [[Inner Mongolia]]. It is part of the '''Dongfeng Aerospace City''' (Base 10). Although the facility is geographically located within [[Ejin Banner]] of [[Inner Mongolia]]'s [[Alxa League]], it is named after the nearest city, [[Jiuquan]] in [[Gansu|Gansu Province]].  The launch center straddles both sides of the [[Ruo Shui]] river.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-asia-space-race/chinasidebar.html</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center with sign.jpg|thumb|The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center sign]]
It was founded in 1958, the first of China's four spaceports. As with all Chinese launch facilities, it is remote and generally closed to foreigners.

The Satellite Launch Center is a part of Dongfeng Space City ({{lang|zh|东风航天城}}), also known as ''Base 10'' ({{lang|zh|十号基地}}) or ''Dongfeng base'' ({{lang|zh|东风基地}}).  The Dongfeng site  also includes [[PLAAF]] test flight facilities, a space museum and a martyr's cemetery ({{lang|zh|东风烈士陵园}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmg.xinhuanet.com/nmgdcy/lvyou/2007-12/05/content_11855918.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724233031/http://www.nmg.xinhuanet.com/nmgdcy/lvyou/2007-12/05/content_11855918.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 24, 2009|title=航天科技游圣地——东风航天城 (The Jerusalem of the space tech journey-Dongfeng space city)|publisher=新华网内蒙古频道 (Xinhua network inner-Mongol channel)|date=December 5, 2007|access-date=May 7, 2008|language=zh}}</ref>

JSLC is usually used to launch vehicles into lower and medium orbits with large orbital inclination angles, as well as testing medium to long-range [[missiles]]. Its facilities are state of the art and provide support to every phase of a satellite launch campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}} The site includes the Technical Center, the Launch Complex, the Launch Control Center, the Mission Command and Control Center and various other logistical support systems.

The center covers 2800&nbsp;km² and may have housing for as many as 20,000 people. The facilities and launch support equipment were likely modelled on Soviet counterparts and the [[Soviet Union]] likely provided technical support to Jiuquan.

The launch center has been the focus of many of China's ventures into space, including their first [[satellite]] [[Dong Fang Hong I]] 
in 1970, and their first [[manned space mission|crewed space mission]] ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' on 15 October 2003.  As of 2021, all Chinese crewed space flights, meaning all flights in the [[Shenzhou program]] including crewed flights to the [[Tiangong space station]], have launched from Jiuquan.

In August 2016, China launched the first quantum communication satellite, the "[[Quantum Experiments at Space Scale]]", from the Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/33760-china-launches-quantum-communications-satellite.html|title=China Launches Pioneering 'Hack-Proof' Quantum-Communications Satellite|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=August 16, 2016|website=space.com|publisher=[[Space.com]]|access-date=August 16, 2016}}</ref>

In August 2018, Chinese private rocket manufacturing startups [[I-Space (Chinese company)|i-Space]] and [[OneSpace]] launched [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital]] rockets from the center.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://spacenews.com/chinese-startups-onespace-ispace-succeed-with-suborbital-launches/|title=Chinese startups OneSpace, iSpace succeed with suborbital launches|last=Jones|first=Andrew|date=2018-09-07 |access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref> On July 25, 2019, the first Chinese private orbital launch took place from Jiuquan as I-Space launched their Hyberbola-1 rocket.
