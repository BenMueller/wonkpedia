The second day of the Ukrainian invasion was heralded in the early morning with a large attack of missiles on Ukrainian sites. However, there were indications of slowing Russian troop movements, with alleged looting of fuel and other resources. While the degree of fighting and resistance continued, realistically the draft of all men from 18-60 instituted by the Ukrainian government was unable to be enforced as many fled across the border.

Shelling early in the day. NATO meeting. Radiation spike from kicking up dirt around Chernobyl. Places where Russian troops were stalled and running out of fuel. Pictures of missiles hitting the ground/parts. When did sirens go off? [https://docs.google.com/document/d/13mMXLVloh2vvg9AnwfnxgyAFb6e4BKccDc2g0cIPq5c/edit?usp=sharing Add these sources]. About 40 cruise missiles were launched, adding to the 160 used the previous day.<ref>https://twitter.com/DanLamothe/status/1497255693685907456?s=20&t=9QWYPWMHeMrNVWOrM4LJvQ</ref> However, initial intelligence claims indicated that massive shelling of major cities was to come early in the day, which appear to have been incorrect.
