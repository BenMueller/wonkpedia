== Articles ==

* There should probably be some pages on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
* There should '''definitely''' be a technical page on Hypersonic glide vehicles. Probably multiple pages, TBH.

== Guides ==

* How to identify different types of rockets/fuels by the plume/flame. Solid vs. liquid is pretty easy, but what is the variation between different liquid fuel colors?
* There's a bunch of stuff from Jeffrey's open source class that I could make guides on (get permission first)
